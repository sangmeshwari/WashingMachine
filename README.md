# WashingMachine
Verilog HDL is an Hardware Description Language. Every device that we study in Digital Electronics, whose hardware is possible, can be described in a language (code). Every machine, that we come across in today's world can be studied by making its FSM (Finite State Machine).
Today with the help of simple FSM, we are going to see the verilog code for washing machine. I am considering only few states in this.(All features of washing machine are not covered here)

First of all, Let us see the FSM of a simple washing machine:

The output waveform of the FSM will be like

The coverage of the above sequential design is

 We have got the overall coverage of our design as 90.36%.
